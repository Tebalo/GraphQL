 Difference between Schema and Instance in DBMS
 1. Instances:
    Instances are the collection of information stored at a particular moment.
    The instances can be changed by certain CRUD operations  as like addition,
    deletion of data. It may be noted that any search query will not make any
    kind of changes in the instances
 2. Schema:
    Schema is the overall description of the database. The basic structure of 
    how the data will be stored in the database is called schema.
Example:
Teacher table
    name: String
    doj: date
    dob: date
Schema                                        | Instance
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It is the overall description of the database | it is the collection of information stored in a database 
                                              | at a particular moment
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                             
Schema is same for whole database             | Data in instances can be changed using addition, deletion,
                                              | updation.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------                                        
Does not change frequently                    | Changes frequently
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Defines the basic structure of the database   | It is the set of information stored at a particular time.
